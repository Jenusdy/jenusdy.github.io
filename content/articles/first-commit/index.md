## Hello There

```kotlin
  fun main() {
    println("Hello, World! This is the initial commit.")
  }
```

This marks the **initial commit** of my personal portfolio built using **Gatsby**. This project serves as a space where I showcase my skills, projects, and contributions in **web development, data science, GIS, and software engineering**.
